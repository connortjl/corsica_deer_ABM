6-7 fawns / 10 femake deer/year elsewhere on Corsica - 65% reproduction chance for one fawn?

Fawns hang about near their mum till at least 1 year old - haven't seen a lot of emigration, but will talk to people elsewhere

Home ranges - larger in more open environments, and fawns typically start their HR at the edge of mums HR - so more open environments facilitate greater emigration 

95-98% survival - some deer released 20 years ago are still going. Not hunted in Corsica (only a lil' bit of illegal hunting)
